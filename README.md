Note:
* All paths, unless otherwise specified, are relative to the `pacman` folder.
* The `TestPrograms` package is for our own testing. It is not part of the functionalities required by the spec.
* Similarly, the `editorTests`, `correctMaps`, and `data` folder contain our own tests for the app.
* The `sprites` folder contains both the sprites used by the game and the editor's data.
* `errorLog.txt` in the `errorLog` folder is where the game and level checking reports to.
* Only the `src` folder contains code for this project.
* The `Driver` program in `src` is the entry point of this application.
