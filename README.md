* The game and level checking will report to `pacman/errorLogs.txt`.
* The `GameCallBack` will report to `pacman/Log.txt`
* Only the `src` folder contains code for this project.
* `src.Driver.main()` is the entry point for this application.
* The `src.TestPrograms` package is for our own testing. It is not part of the functionalities required by the spec.
